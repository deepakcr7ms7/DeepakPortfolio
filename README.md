Created seven disease classification models with TensorFlow, Random Forest and XGBoost to analyse patientsâ€™
medical records, achieving over 90% accuracy. Integrated trained models to create an application with Flask framework.

The objective of this project is to analyze the 3 million grocery orders from more than 200,000 Instacart users and predict which previously purchased item will be in user's next order. Customer segmentation and affinity analysis are also done to study user purchase patterns.

Built a tool that flexibly generates hardware to accelerate the evaluation of multiple layers of
convolution system with a non-linear function called a ReLU after each convolution. Designed it using digital system design techniques
